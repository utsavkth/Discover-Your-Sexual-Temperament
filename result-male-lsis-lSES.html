      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your sexual temperament is grounded and steady. You don’t feel blocked or anxious about sex (low brakes), but you also don’t experience intense or frequent arousal unless something truly clicks.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You’re probably not driven by constant sexual thoughts. You might enjoy sex and intimacy, but you don’t chase it. And when it does happen, it may take a while for you to get fully engaged. That doesn’t mean you’re cold — it means your system just doesn’t rush.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may have been told you should want sex more, or feel confused when others seem to be running hot while you’re running neutral. But this isn’t a flaw. It’s just your baseline. You don’t need to be “fired up” all the time to be a deeply sexual person.
      </p>
    
      <h3>🧠 For Men Like You</h3>
      <p>
        Your profile is actually pretty chill — low anxiety, low pressure, low overdrive. But that ease can also lead to misunderstandings. Partners might think you’re not interested. You might wonder, “Why don’t I feel more?” But there’s nothing missing. You just need <em>meaningful cues</em> to really feel activated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your sexual expression is likely tied more to connection, comfort, and timing than urgency or raw desire. And when those conditions are present? You show up — fully, calmly, and genuinely.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ Tips That Work for Your Natural Tempo</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🌱 <strong>Don’t force the spark:</strong> your system doesn’t respond well to pressure or performance. Let arousal come to you in its own time.</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Communicate your pace:</strong> let partners know that you’re open and interested, even if your desire unfolds slowly.</li>
        <li>🧘 <strong>Explore slow sensuality:</strong> massage, long kisses, shared baths — you may feel more tuned in through body presence than mental arousal.</li>
        <li>🎧 <strong>Use subtle stimulation:</strong> music, voice, emotional storytelling — these can awaken your SES in softer ways than visual stimulation.</li>
        <li>💡 <strong>Redefine desire:</strong> it’s not about hunger. It’s about curiosity, safety, and depth. And you’ve got all of that.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <details class="explanation-box">
        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your brake — it slows arousal in response to stress, fear, or emotional disconnection. A low SIS means you’re generally relaxed and unbothered by pressure or shame.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your gas pedal — it responds to stimulation, emotional cues, or erotic energy. A low SES means you need specific or strong signals to feel turned on, and it may take time to build.</p>
        <p>This combo doesn’t mean you’re not sexual. It means your sexuality is more quiet and selective — and that’s a beautiful thing.</p>
