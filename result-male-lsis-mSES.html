      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your sexual temperament is easygoing and steady. You’re not easily stressed or inhibited (low SIS), and your arousal shows up when the context feels right (medium SES). You’re the kind of person who’s calm, connected, and fully present when desire appears — and that’s a strength.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You’re not constantly driven by sexual thoughts — but you’re open and responsive when the moment is right. A good conversation, a meaningful look, shared laughter, or simple physical closeness can all activate your arousal.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don’t feel rushed, and you’re not thrown off easily. Because your brake system is quiet, you’re often relaxed in sexual or romantic situations. But because your SES is medium, you don’t light up at every little thing — and that’s okay.
      </p>
    
      <h3>🧠 For Men Like You</h3>
      <p>
        You’ve got a flexible and grounded sexual rhythm. But in long-term relationships, your easygoing nature can sometimes be misread as disinterest. You’re not lacking passion — you’re just tuned into the <em>right timing</em>, not the constant urge.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re likely someone who thrives in emotionally safe relationships with room for shared play, curiosity, and meaningful intimacy. Keep that energy alive, and your desire will continue to show up — organically, reliably, and without drama.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ What Supports Your Natural Desire</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🧘 <strong>Stay present, not performative:</strong> you don’t need to prove your arousal — your calm, grounded energy is already enough.</li>
        <li>🎶 <strong>Keep desire fresh through context:</strong> new environments, creative intimacy, or playful moments can help your SES stay activated.</li>
        <li>🪞 <strong>Reflect after intimacy:</strong> what made the moment enjoyable? What made it easy to connect? These clues guide your future cues.</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Speak up about your rhythm:</strong> your partner may need to hear that your pace is intentional — not distant.</li>
        <li>✨ <strong>Use slow-building cues:</strong> music, voice, long touch, and eye contact are powerful for you — even more than instant stimulation.</li>
      </ul>

        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your brake — it activates in response to stress, shame, or fear. A low SIS means you don’t get derailed easily, and you feel safe expressing your desire.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your gas pedal — it revs up when you’re emotionally or sensually engaged. A medium SES means you respond well, but you’re not constantly running hot. You need the right vibe.</p>
        <p>This combo makes you one of the most emotionally balanced profiles — your desire is real, but it arrives on your terms.</p>
