      <p>Your sexual temperament isn't about what's "normal"â€”it's about what works for <strong>you</strong>. Whether you need more trust, stimulation, privacy, or connection, this worksheet will help you figure out what conditions bring your desire alive.</p>

      <h2>ðŸ§  Step 1: Your Turn-Off Triggers (Brakes)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What kinds of thoughts, environments, or feelings shut you down?</li>
        <li>Examples: performance anxiety, clutter, distractions, insecurity, poor communication</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ðŸ”¥ Step 2: Your Turn-On Cues (Accelerators)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What kind of sights, smells, behaviors, or feelings turn you on?</li>
        <li>Examples: partner's scent, music, affectionate touch, confidence, emotional intimacy</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ðŸ§© Step 3: Ideal Contexts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe a time you felt most connected and arousedâ€”what was present?</li>
        <li>What would your perfect environment look like if you could design it from scratch?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ðŸ““ Step 4: Journal Prompts</h2>
      <p>Use these prompts in a private journal or your notes app:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"The last time I felt safe and turned on was..."</li>
        <li>"One thing that helps me drop into my body is..."</li>
        <li>"If I could ask my partner for one thing before sex, it would be..."</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ðŸŒ± Final Note</h2>
      <p>This isnâ€™t about fixing yourself. Itâ€™s about <strong>understanding yourself</strong>. Your context is your key. Set it up right, and the rest will follow naturally.</p>
