      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your system has strong brakes and a quiet gas pedal — and that’s more common than you think.</p>
    
      <p>This combo means you’re highly sensitive to stress, pressure, or discomfort (your SIS), while also needing just the right kind of cues to even begin feeling turned on (your SES). It’s not that you don’t want sex — it’s that your body needs more <em>permission</em>, more <em>safety</em>, and more <em>intentionality</em>.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>You might struggle to “get in the mood” spontaneously, especially if your mind is distracted, you’re feeling emotionally distant, or the environment feels off. When sex happens too fast or without emotional grounding, your body might not respond — or it might shut down completely.</p>
    
      <p>This can leave you wondering, “Why don’t I feel what I’m supposed to feel?” But let’s be real: most of what you’ve been taught about sex is built on scripts that don’t fit your nervous system. This isn’t dysfunction — it’s just mismatched context.</p>
    
      <h3>👩‍🦰 For Women Like You</h3>
      <p>So many women with this profile have silently questioned their worth — believing something must be wrong with them. But there’s nothing broken here. You are built for <em>depth over speed</em>, <em>safety over spontaneity</em>, and <em>connection over performance</em>.</p>
    
      <p>Your desire isn’t gone. It’s waiting for the right conditions to gently unfold.</p>
    
      <h3>✅ Gentle Strategies That Support You</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🌱 <strong>Practice body awareness:</strong> yoga, breathing, or body scans can help you reconnect to your sensual self — without pressure.</li>
        <li>📖 <strong>Keep a Sexy Context Journal:</strong> after intimate moments, jot down what worked, what didn’t, what helped, and what hurt. Your patterns are your guide.</li>
        <li>💌 <strong>Prioritize emotional intimacy:</strong> meaningful conversations, affirmations, or acts of love often come before physical arousal for you.</li>
        <li>🕯️ <strong>Design calming rituals:</strong> long showers, ambient music, cozy blankets — anything that says “you’re safe, you’re allowed to feel.”</li>
        <li>🫶 <strong>Give yourself time:</strong> maybe your arousal starts with slow dancing, a heartfelt compliment, or reading erotica solo. That’s all valid.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <details class="explanation-box">
        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your internal brake. It picks up on stress, fear, shame, or anything that feels “off” and slows your arousal response. A high SIS means your brake is very sensitive — it’s not overreacting; it’s protecting.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your internal gas pedal. It notices erotic cues, emotional closeness, playful energy — and builds arousal from there. A low SES means it takes more or stronger cues to activate.</p>
        <p>This combination just means your body needs <em>intentional care</em>. The goal is not to “fix” you — it’s to help you feel safe enough to open up.</p>
