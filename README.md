# Discover Your Sexual Temperament

Welcome to the official repository for the **Sexual Temperament Reflection Tool**, inspired by the science in _Come As You Are_ by Dr. Emily Nagoski. 💜

> **This isn’t a quiz.**  
> It’s a mirror — a guided exploration into what turns you on, what turns you off, and what it means to understand your desire *without shame or pressure*.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

Modern sex education? Either too clinical, too vague, or lost in algorithmic chaos.  
I wanted to build something that actually helps — something:

- Emotionally intelligent, not performative  
- Grounded in neuroscience, not trends  
- Reflective, not reductive  
- Made for people who don’t usually talk about this stuff

This project exists to:
- Help you connect the dots between your **context** and your **arousal**
- Show that desire isn’t a “drive” — it’s a system of signals (SIS & SES)
- Normalize differences in sexual response without judgment

It’s the third chapter in a trilogy of emotional self-discovery:
- 🧠 [Discover Your Attachment Style](https://utsavkth.github.io/Discover-Your-Attachment-Style/)
- ❤️ [Discover Your Love Language](https://utsavkth.github.io/Discover-Your-Love-Language/)
- 🔥 Discover Your Sexual Temperament (this one)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Start at `index.html`**  
   Enter your name + choose your gender identity

2. **Reflection journey begins on `start.html`**  
   You’ll go through 11 tailored prompts based on your gender identity

3. **Answers are analyzed on `result.html`**  
   Your Sexual Inhibition (SIS) and Excitation (SES) profiles are calculated

4. **You’re shown 1 of 27 personalized temperament results**  
   Including practical insights, emotional patterns, and a link to go deeper with the `sexy-contexts.html` worksheet
