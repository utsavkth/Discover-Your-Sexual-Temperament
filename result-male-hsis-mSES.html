      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your sexual temperament shows a mix of potential and protection. You’re capable of arousal — but only when the conditions are right. Your mind wants it, but your nervous system needs to trust it.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You may feel desire in a slow, steady way — a kiss, a deep conversation, the right music — it starts to build. But then something changes: the lights feel too bright, your partner seems distracted, or a sudden doubt enters your mind... and it’s gone. Your body hits the brakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can feel frustrating. One moment, you’re tuned in. The next, you’re disconnected — and wondering what happened. But this isn’t dysfunction. It’s your system doing its job: staying emotionally safe, not just physically ready.
      </p>
    
      <h3>🧠 For Men Like You</h3>
      <p>
        This profile doesn’t mean you’re “low drive” or broken. It means you need **emotional congruence**. You need your mind, body, and environment to all say yes — not just one of them. And when they do? You can show up fully.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here’s the catch: society rarely gives men permission to be this way. You’re expected to perform, not reflect. To push through, not check in. But your nervous system doesn’t lie — and it deserves respect.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ Supportive Tools for Your Wiring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>💬 <strong>Talk about pressure:</strong> stress or fear of letting someone down might be activating your SIS. The more openly you speak, the less control it has.</li>
        <li>🕯️ <strong>Curate intentional intimacy:</strong> set the mood, slow things down, stay grounded in the moment — your SES needs a soft runway.</li>
        <li>🪞 <strong>Get curious about your brakes:</strong> Is it fear? Shame? Disconnection? Name it, and you reclaim your power over it.</li>
        <li>📖 <strong>Learn your arousal style:</strong> fantasize, write, read, explore ideas that turn you on mentally — arousal often begins in your mind.</li>
        <li>🧠 <strong>Drop the “shoulds”:</strong> you don’t need to want it all the time. You need to want it when it’s real, safe, and mutual. That’s strength.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <details class="explanation-box">
        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your brake — it responds quickly to emotional stress, shame, fear, or pressure. High SIS means you’re especially sensitive to these signals, and they can easily override arousal.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your gas pedal — it responds to intimacy, eroticism, and sensual context. A medium SES means your desire builds gradually, not instantly, and needs emotional support to stay active.</p>
        <p>Put simply: You’re someone who thrives on trust, intention, and connection — not just stimulation.</p>
