      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your sexual system is open, responsive, and wired for possibility. You don’t carry a lot of shame or inhibition around arousal, and when the mood is right — your system lights up fast.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You might find yourself frequently turned on by emotional closeness, sensuality, aesthetic beauty, or even playful energy. You don’t need things to be perfect — just real, safe, and stimulating. Your body knows how to say yes, and you don’t second-guess that.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, your openness may be misread. People might assume you’re “always in the mood,” or mistake your responsiveness for availability. But you still have needs — for slowness, for consent, for intimacy that feels mutual and meaningful.
      </p>
    
      <h3>🌈 For Non-Binary or Fluid Identities</h3>
      <p>
        You may have been praised for being “easygoing” or “open-minded” — but not always <em>seen</em> in your full complexity. Just because your body says yes easily doesn’t mean that’s the whole story. You deserve to be approached with care, not assumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether your fluidity shows up in identity, desire, or expression — your wiring is valid, beautiful, and worth protecting. Arousal that comes easily still deserves respect.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ Tips for Channeling Your Energy with Intention</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>💡 <strong>Check in before acting:</strong> even when desire shows up fast, pause and ask yourself: “Is this what I want emotionally, too?”</li>
        <li>🧘 <strong>Balance your responsiveness with reflection:</strong> being easily aroused doesn’t mean saying yes to everything — it means choosing with clarity.</li>
        <li>🎨 <strong>Play with sensuality:</strong> you’re highly responsive — so explore sensory pleasure, erotic creativity, or fantasy in safe, grounded ways.</li>
        <li>📖 <strong>Write about what excites you:</strong> journaling or daydreaming can help shape your arousal into something that feels intentional, not impulsive.</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Set boundaries early:</strong> sometimes people expect more just because you’re responsive — your job is to remind them: consent is ongoing.</li>
      </ul>

        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your brake — it activates when things feel unsafe, disconnected, or pressured. A low SIS means you’re not easily shut down by stress or shame — you feel comfortable exploring your desires.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your gas pedal — it lights up when something feels good, intimate, or erotically charged. A high SES means your desire is easily and strongly activated when the vibe is right.</p>
        <p>This profile is confident and passionate — but like all profiles, it still needs care, pacing, and emotional safety to flourish.</p>
