      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, based on your responses, your sexual temperament reflects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🚦 High sensitivity to internal and external "brakes" (SIS)</li>
        <li>💡 A balanced response to sexual "go-signals" (SES)</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h3>💭 What This Means</h3>
      <p>
        You’re someone whose desire doesn’t arrive on command — and that’s completely okay. For you, arousal needs to feel emotionally anchored. Your mind scans for safety before your body can say yes. Stress, judgment, awkwardness, or rushing? Total shutdown.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here's the beauty: when the brakes are low and the vibe is right — emotional closeness, warmth, playful connection — you can ease into arousal with presence and grace. You're not wired for friction. You’re wired for <em>flow</em>.
      </p>
    
      <h3>👩‍🦰 A Note for Women Like You</h3>
      <p>
        If you’ve ever thought, “Why can’t I just want it more?” — please know, you’re not alone. Most messaging around sex assumes that desire is instant, always-on, and mostly physical. But your body works differently. You need trust, safety, and time — not a performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t about low libido. It’s about <strong>high intelligence in your nervous system</strong>. You feel deeply, so you need space to arrive fully.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ Try These (Not Just “Get in the Mood”)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>💆‍♀️ <strong>Build trust first:</strong> emotional security is your greatest aphrodisiac. You don’t “ease into sex” — you ease into safety.</li>
        <li>🌿 <strong>Minimize distractions:</strong> dim lights, soft clothes, silent phones — this clears the emotional noise your brake picks up.</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Voice your boundaries:</strong> say when you need to slow down, pause, or shift — this isn’t rejection; it’s co-regulation.</li>
        <li>🪞 <strong>Reflect on context:</strong> keep track of moments where arousal felt easy — what was present? Who were you with? What wasn’t there?</li>
        <li>🌀 <strong>De-shame your pace:</strong> “slow to start” doesn’t mean “less sexual.” It means more depth, more richness, more realness.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <details class="explanation-box">
        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your internal brake. It notices any signal that something’s off — emotionally, physically, or mentally — and it slows your arousal. A high SIS means this system is highly responsive to stress, distraction, or fear.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your accelerator. It picks up on erotic cues — like skin contact, sensual vibes, or emotional closeness — and turns the ignition. Medium SES means you respond well, but not instantly or automatically. You need the right vibe.</p>
        <p>This profile isn't a dysfunction. It’s an invitation to be more attuned, intentional, and compassionate with your body’s rhythms.</p>
