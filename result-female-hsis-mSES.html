      <h2>Your Sexual Temperament Summary</h2>
      <p class="subheading">Profile: <strong>High Inhibition (SIS) + Medium Excitation (SES)</strong></p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, based on your responses, your sexual temperament reflects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🚦 High sensitivity to internal and external "brakes" (SIS)</li>
        <li>💡 A balanced response to sexual "go-signals" (SES)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What This Means</h3>
      <p>You likely need a calm, emotionally safe, and unrushed environment to feel turned on. Distractions, pressure, or anxiety can shut down arousal quickly. That’s not a flaw—it’s your brain protecting you. It just means your sexual system needs the right context, not more stimulation.</p>

      <p>On the excitation side, you respond to sexual cues when the vibe is right—romantic, emotionally connected, or novel. You may enjoy sexual spontaneity, but only when your emotional and mental brakes are off.</p>

      <h3>Real Talk</h3>
      <p>High SIS is the strongest predictor of sexual difficulties—not because something is wrong with you, but because our culture doesn’t support the slow, safety-first, trust-based arousal path that you need. The solution? Build sexy *contexts*, not pressure. Reduce brakes, don't just push accelerators.</p>

      <h3>Suggestions from the Science</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>💆‍♀️ Prioritize trust and safety before physical intimacy</li>
        <li>🌿 Set up private, calm environments—no rush, no distractions</li>
        <li>💬 Practice communication about what slows you down</li>
        <li>🔍 Try the “Sexy Contexts” worksheet to discover what really works for you</li>
      </ul>
