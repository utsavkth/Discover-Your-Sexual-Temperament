      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your results suggest a gentle and steady sexual temperament — low brakes and low acceleration. You’re not easily shut down, but you also don’t feel a strong drive to pursue sexual experiences spontaneously. And that’s perfectly valid.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>You probably don’t get aroused by random cues or fiery chemistry. Sex might not be something you actively crave unless conditions are just right. You can be open to intimacy — but it often unfolds from closeness, warmth, and trust over time, rather than sudden sparks.</p>
    
      <p>This can sometimes feel confusing in a culture that glorifies urgency, passion, and “can’t-keep-my-hands-off-you” vibes. But your pace isn’t broken — it’s <em>real</em>, grounded, and reflective of a quieter nervous system.</p>
    
      <h3>👩‍🦰 For Women Like You</h3>
      <p>You might have asked yourself: “Why don’t I feel that hunger everyone talks about?” or “Am I missing something?” The truth is, you're not. Your system is just more subtle in how it processes desire. And that’s not a flaw — it’s a <strong>different kind of strength</strong>.</p>
    
      <p>You may thrive in long-term emotional intimacy, where sex becomes part of connection — not a separate, fiery thing. And when that connection is strong? Your arousal can surprise even you.</p>
    
      <h3>✅ Supportive Approaches for Your Temperament</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🕯️ <strong>Start with emotional closeness:</strong> long hugs, eye contact, quiet time together — these lay the foundation for deeper arousal.</li>
        <li>🪞 <strong>Give yourself permission to not be “in the mood” all the time:</strong> this doesn’t make you any less loving or intimate.</li>
        <li>📚 <strong>Explore arousal gently:</strong> reading, daydreaming, fantasy — all can be helpful without pressure to perform.</li>
        <li>🎨 <strong>Be creative with intimacy:</strong> sensual massage, shared rituals, playful exploration — let intimacy be more than just sex.</li>
        <li>💗 <strong>Focus on “what brings me closer?”</strong> rather than “how do I get turned on?” Your answer is often found in connection, not in intensity.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <details class="explanation-box">
        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your brain’s brake. It slows arousal when something feels off — stress, fear, or distraction. A low SIS means you’re generally not held back by those things. You’re open.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your gas pedal. It responds to erotic cues and revs up arousal. A low SES means those signals don’t trigger you easily — you may need more time or intimacy to get there.</p>
        <p>This doesn’t mean you’re not sexual. It means your sexuality is quiet, gentle, and often tied to deeper emotional context.</p>
