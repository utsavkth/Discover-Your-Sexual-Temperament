      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your results show a sexual temperament that’s often misread — even by you. You’re someone whose arousal system is cautious (high brakes) and slow to ignite (low gas). That doesn’t mean you’re disinterested. It means your body moves on a deeper clock.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You might not feel spontaneous desire often — or at all. And when you do, it may vanish quickly if there’s stress, pressure, or emotional disconnect. Your brake system is highly sensitive. It watches for anything that feels off, and it shuts things down to protect you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, your accelerator needs strong, clear signals to even begin the process of arousal — and those signals don’t always show up in daily life. You may find that arousal happens more in imagination, or only in deeply secure emotional contexts.
      </p>
    
      <h3>🧠 For Men Like You</h3>
      <p>
        This is a tough combo in a world that says “real men are always ready.” But the truth? You're not lacking. You're layered. You don’t perform on command — you respond to safety, warmth, and trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may have internalized shame around this — thinking you're “not enough,” or feeling frustrated that desire doesn’t show up when expected. But your body isn’t a machine. It’s a gatekeeper. And it only opens when it feels truly, deeply okay.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ Gentle Practices That Support You</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🛏️ <strong>Slow it all down:</strong> you likely need much more time than most to feel safe, relaxed, and open. Give yourself that time — no rush.</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Talk about your brakes:</strong> whether it’s performance pressure, stress, or emotional disconnection — name it so you can work with it, not against it.</li>
        <li>📖 <strong>Explore your inner arousal language:</strong> fantasy, touch, deep emotional intimacy — these may turn you on more than visual cues or typical scripts.</li>
        <li>🕯️ <strong>Design a context that feels deeply safe:</strong> lighting, scent, music, warmth — your nervous system needs calm, not chaos.</li>
        <li>💡 <strong>Redefine masculinity for yourself:</strong> true sexual strength isn’t about readiness. It’s about attunement, consent, and care — and you’ve got all of that.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <details class="explanation-box">
        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your brain’s brake. It responds to stress, worry, fear, or anything that feels unsafe. A high SIS means your system watches closely and slows things down quickly to protect you.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your gas pedal. It revs up when you’re turned on by sensuality, closeness, or stimulation. A low SES means you need stronger, more specific cues to feel aroused — and even then, it takes time.</p>
        <p>This combo isn’t broken — it’s thoughtful. You’re someone who feels safest when sex isn’t rushed and when intimacy is truly mutual.</p>
