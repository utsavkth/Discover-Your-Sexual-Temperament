      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your system says YES and NO at the same time — and that’s not a contradiction. It’s a form of brilliance.</p>
    
      <p>You scored high on both the <strong>gas pedal (SES)</strong> and the <strong>brake (SIS)</strong>. That means you can experience powerful desire — but only when your internal and external world says it’s safe. You’re someone who feels deeply, but also protects deeply.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>Maybe you’ve had nights where a single touch or glance sent your mind racing with desire — your body all in. But another night, a tiny stressor — a messy room, a moment of self-doubt, a partner rushing things — and suddenly it’s like someone yanked the handbrake. It’s not random. It’s how your system was built.</p>
    
      <p>This doesn’t mean you’re “too complicated” or “not in the mood enough.” It means you need <em>the right context</em> — and when you have that, your desire can be rich, deep, and sustaining.</p>
    
      <h3>👩‍🦰 For Women Like You</h3>
      <p>If you grew up with mixed messages about sex — like "be sexy but not too much," or "want it but don’t show it" — your brakes might be hypersensitive from years of pressure or fear of judgment. And if no one told you how your unique wiring works, you might’ve assumed you were broken.</p>
    
      <p>You’re not. You just need space that honors both your desire and your boundaries. That honors <em>you</em>.</p>
    
      <h3>✅ Try These Instead of “Just Relax”</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🧠 <strong>Mentally rehearse arousal:</strong> fantasize, journal, or visualize erotic scenes where you feel fully safe and desired — this helps prep your SES.</li>
        <li>🎧 <strong>Engage your senses:</strong> scent, sound, lighting — sensuality starts in the nervous system, not just the genitals.</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Name your brakes without guilt:</strong> "I want this, but I need to slow down" is sexy honesty, not rejection.</li>
        <li>🛁 <strong>Design your environment:</strong> tidy up, use warm lighting, put on your playlist — let your space say “you’re safe to open.”</li>
        <li>💗 <strong>Be curious, not critical:</strong> when desire disappears, don’t shame it. Ask it what it needs.</li>
      </ul>

        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your brake. It responds to stress, worry, discomfort, or anything that signals “not safe right now.” A high SIS means your brake is extra sensitive — even subtle stuff can make it kick in.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your accelerator. It notices erotic cues, closeness, and sensual details. A high SES means you can get turned on easily — <em>but only if your brakes aren’t in the way</em>.</p>
        <p>Both systems are normal. The magic comes from understanding how yours dance together.</p>
