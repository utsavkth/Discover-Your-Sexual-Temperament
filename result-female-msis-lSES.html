      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your sexual temperament reflects a thoughtful balance: your brake system (SIS) is moderately sensitive, and your accelerator (SES) tends to stay quiet unless the moment is just right.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You may find that sex isn’t often top-of-mind. You’re open to it — but only in the right context. Even then, it might take time to feel connected or turned on. It’s not that you’re unwilling. It’s that your system asks for <em>meaning before momentum</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional stress, disconnection, or pressure can put the brakes on quickly. And even in good situations, your arousal might not surge without help. That’s not a problem — that’s your body saying: “I need something deeper to get there.”
      </p>
    
      <h3>👩‍🦰 For Women Like You</h3>
      <p>
        This profile is common — and often overlooked. You’re probably not someone who chases novelty or feels spontaneous desire often. And if you've ever worried, “Am I just not sexual enough?” — know this: <strong>low SES doesn’t mean low worth</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your desire might be more emotional, contextual, or even intellectual. You’re not disconnected — you’re just not loud about it. That’s a valid, beautiful form of sexuality.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ Ways to Nurture Your Desire (Without Forcing It)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>💗 <strong>Start with connection:</strong> meaningful conversations, shared humor, or small acts of care — they’re often your biggest turn-ons.</li>
        <li>📓 <strong>Track what works:</strong> reflect on what made you feel most intimate, safe, or aroused in the past. These are your personal arousal cues.</li>
        <li>🧘 <strong>Lower the noise:</strong> your SIS can activate from subtle stress. Quiet the environment, your schedule, and your self-judgment.</li>
        <li>🪄 <strong>Redefine intimacy:</strong> sex doesn’t always have to be fiery. Intimate touch, eye contact, or a slow night in can all be erotic in your language.</li>
        <li>💌 <strong>Share your truth:</strong> if you need more time or emotional grounding, say it. A partner who gets that will help unlock your SES.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <details class="explanation-box">
        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your internal brake — it responds to pressure, stress, or anything that feels emotionally “off.” Medium SIS means you can go with the flow in healthy situations, but your system will gently slow you down if something feels wrong.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your internal gas pedal — it reacts to arousal cues like intimacy, sensuality, or emotional closeness. A low SES means you need stronger or more specific cues to feel turned on — and that’s perfectly normal.</p>
        <p>This profile isn't about dysfunction. It’s about intentionality. You move when it feels right — and that’s deeply empowering.</p>
