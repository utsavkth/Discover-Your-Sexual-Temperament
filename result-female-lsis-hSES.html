      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your results show a low sensitivity to brakes (SIS) and a high sensitivity to sexual cues (SES). In plain terms? You're someone who’s <em>highly responsive</em>, curious, and open — when the vibe hits right.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>You may find that desire often shows up quickly, even unexpectedly. A smell, a touch, a memory, a scene — and suddenly your body is ready. You don’t need long mental preparation or complex emotional conditions. You’re wired to respond.</p>
    
      <p>But that doesn’t mean you’re “always in the mood” — or that you should be. Even with low brakes, your nervous system still needs respect, consent, and care. Desire may be quick to light, but it still deserves depth.</p>
    
      <h3>👩‍🦰 For Women Like You</h3>
      <p>In many ways, your profile aligns with cultural expectations of how women “should” feel about sex — spontaneous, turned on, enthusiastic. But sometimes, that creates pressure. You might’ve felt guilty when desire <em>didn’t</em> show up, or wondered why partners expect you to always be responsive just because you often are.</p>
    
      <p>Here’s the truth: your profile is a gift, but it still requires boundaries, self-checks, and rest. You are more than your sexual readiness.</p>
    
      <h3>✅ Suggestions That Support Your Balance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🔥 <strong>Honor your responsiveness:</strong> if something turns you on quickly, don’t question it — follow it with curiosity.</li>
        <li>🛑 <strong>Practice pause and check-in:</strong> even if brakes are light, ask yourself “Do I want this? Am I emotionally okay?”</li>
        <li>🪷 <strong>Keep sex nourishing, not just exciting:</strong> high SES doesn’t mean you always need novelty. Comfort and safety matter too.</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Communicate expectations:</strong> tell partners, “Yes, I get turned on fast — but that doesn’t mean I always want to act on it.”</li>
        <li>📌 <strong>Set boundaries for sustainability:</strong> your gas pedal is strong — but even sports cars need brakes.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <details class="explanation-box">
        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your internal brake — it slows you down in response to stress, fear, shame, or discomfort. A <strong>low SIS</strong> means you’re not easily disrupted by distractions or worries.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your accelerator — it revs you up when your body senses something sexy, intimate, or emotionally engaging. A <strong>high SES</strong> means your system is tuned in and ready when the conditions are right.</p>
        <p>Together, this combo means fast ignition — but fast isn’t always “better.” It’s about <em>knowing yourself</em>, not performing for others.</p>
