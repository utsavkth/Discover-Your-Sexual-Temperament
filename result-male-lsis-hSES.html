      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your profile reveals a bold sexual temperament — low brakes and a strong gas pedal. You’re highly responsive to desire, and few things get in your way. That doesn’t make you shallow — it makes you deeply attuned to stimulation and connection.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You likely get aroused easily — a look, a touch, a moment of emotional intimacy can light you up. And when it hits? You’re ready. Spontaneous desire, fantasy, excitement — it comes naturally to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this same openness can make it tricky to slow down or set boundaries. You might struggle with pacing, or find yourself wanting more even when you're already full. It's not about addiction — it's about intensity. Your system responds fast and often.
      </p>
    
      <h3>🧠 For Men Like You</h3>
      <p>
        People might assume you’re “always in the mood” — but there’s more going on. Yes, you’re highly responsive. But you still deserve slowness, depth, and moments of pause. Just because your body says yes quickly doesn’t mean your heart always does.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, unchecked desire can sometimes lead to emotional disconnect or frustration if intimacy doesn’t match arousal. You're not broken — you're wired for *immense sensitivity*. That’s a strength when paired with awareness.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ Tools to Balance Intensity with Intention</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🪞 <strong>Reflect before reacting:</strong> just because desire shows up doesn’t mean you have to follow it. Pause. Ask: “Is this aligned with what I actually want?”</li>
        <li>🕯️ <strong>Create layered intimacy:</strong> let emotional closeness build alongside arousal — you’ll feel more fulfilled, not just satisfied.</li>
        <li>🎧 <strong>Use your sensitivity creatively:</strong> music, erotic fiction, sensory play — your high SES can thrive with intentional, imaginative cues.</li>
        <li>🧠 <strong>Practice boundaries with desire:</strong> not everything that turns you on deserves your energy. Pick what truly matters.</li>
        <li>💡 <strong>Give yourself recovery time:</strong> even with low brakes, your system still needs rest. Learn to pause without guilt.</li>
      </ul>

        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your inner brake — it slows things down when you feel stressed, ashamed, or disconnected. A low SIS means those inhibitors don’t hit hard — you’re generally relaxed, open, and curious.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your gas pedal — it notices sexual, emotional, and sensual cues and revs you up quickly. A high SES means you get turned on easily and often.</p>
        <p>With this combo, your job isn’t to suppress desire — it’s to guide it. When you pair your drive with discernment, you become unstoppable in the best way.</p>
