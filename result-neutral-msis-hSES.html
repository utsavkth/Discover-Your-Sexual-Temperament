      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your system is vibrant and alert — desire shows up easily when the vibe is right, but it won’t stick around if something feels off. You’re sensitive in both directions: you open fast, but you still care deeply about how safe, mutual, and emotionally aligned the moment feels.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You might get turned on from a look, a touch, a word — your arousal system is quick and curious. But even with all that responsiveness, you still have a filter: your emotional radar is active. If something doesn’t feel right — even subtly — you’ll pause or pull back.
      </p>
      <p>
        This profile often confuses others. They see your openness and assume you’re “always ready.” But readiness doesn’t mean availability. You want sex to be grounded, reciprocal, and emotionally safe — not rushed, assumed, or one-sided.
      </p>
    
      <h3>🌈 For Fluid and Non-Binary Identities</h3>
      <p>
        You might not see yourself represented in most conversations about desire. But your pattern is real: emotionally attuned, sensually present, and fiercely self-respecting. You’re someone who blends sensitivity with strength. You don’t need to explain that duality — just honor it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your arousal is not a performance. It’s a response to real energy, real care, and real context. And that’s powerful.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ Tools to Balance Your Desire with Depth</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🔥 <strong>Use sensory cues that excite you:</strong> scent, sound, lighting, tone — these awaken your SES beautifully.</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Talk openly about pacing:</strong> even with strong desire, you still get to pause and check in — especially if your SIS starts to whisper.</li>
        <li>🧠 <strong>Reflect when arousal drops:</strong> what shifted? What felt off? What would help you feel safe again?</li>
        <li>🌕 <strong>Use fantasy and creativity:</strong> your high SES responds well to stories, imagination, and safe exploration.</li>
        <li>🪞 <strong>Let desire be mutual, not expected:</strong> you deserve partners who meet you where you are — not just where they assume you’ll go.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <details class="explanation-box">
        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your internal brake — it slows things down when something feels emotionally, mentally, or physically “off.” A medium SIS means you’re aware and responsive — but not hyper-reactive.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your gas pedal — it lights up when the vibe is right. A high SES means your body and mind are deeply sensitive to arousal cues — emotional, sensual, or imaginative.</p>
        <p>This combo is powerful: it means you feel desire easily, but you still hold the steering wheel. Your body may say yes, but your heart gets the final word — and that’s wisdom.</p>
