      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your sexual temperament reveals a grounded balance — you’re open to desire, but only when the moment feels emotionally safe and sensually aligned.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You might not be thinking about sex 24/7, but in the right vibe — connection, comfort, curiosity — your desire shows up. It’s there, waiting. But it doesn’t crash through the door. It knocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re neither overly reactive nor overly guarded. You may feel aroused by romance, touch, emotional safety, or sensual cues — but you can just as easily pull back when there’s stress, pressure, or emotional distance.
      </p>
    
      <h3>👩‍🦰 For Women Like You</h3>
      <p>
        Your profile is deeply misunderstood in a culture that celebrates extremes. You're not “hot all the time,” and you're not “shut down.” You live in the gray — the space where arousal unfolds through emotional tone, mood, and connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        That doesn’t make you confusing. It makes you <strong>responsive</strong>. And being responsive means you deserve partners who are patient, present, and emotionally intelligent enough to co-create those moments with you.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ Tools to Support Your Natural Rhythm</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🧭 <strong>Notice your patterns:</strong> track what makes arousal easier vs. harder — emotional tone, setting, energy. You’ll find your own map.</li>
        <li>🕯️ <strong>Design rituals:</strong> light candles, create mood playlists, wear something that feels sensual — small rituals help you transition into desire.</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Communicate timing:</strong> let partners know when you need emotional connection first, or when you need space to get into your body.</li>
        <li>🌱 <strong>Practice micro-intimacy:</strong> long hugs, soft touches, shared jokes — these warm you up gently without pressure.</li>
        <li>💗 <strong>Validate yourself:</strong> desire that comes and goes isn’t broken — it’s intelligent. Your nervous system knows when it’s safe to say yes.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <details class="explanation-box">
        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your inner brake — it notices stress, fear, or disconnect and quietly slows things down. Medium SIS means you’re not easily shut down, but you do respond to off vibes or emotional pressure.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your accelerator — it gets you going when the context feels right. Medium SES means you respond well to arousal cues, but you’re not driven solely by them.</p>
        <p>Together, this profile reflects balance. You’re not “low libido” or “too complicated.” You’re simply someone whose desire blooms when the emotional climate is right.</p>
