      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your sexual temperament is passionate, sensitive, and powerful — but also highly tuned into your environment. You get turned on quickly (SES), but just as quickly, your body can hit the brakes (SIS).</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You might find yourself highly aroused by physical closeness, connection, or even anticipation. Your desire can light up fast — maybe even intensely. But then something small happens — a partner zones out, the mood shifts, you feel pressure to perform — and it’s gone. Your brake system jumps in to protect you.
      </p>
      <p>
        And here’s the key: it’s not about weakness or failure. Your body is doing what it’s wired to do — watch for emotional and physical alignment. The challenge isn’t your desire. It’s the environment your desire needs to thrive.
      </p>
    
      <h3>🧠 For Men Like You</h3>
      <p>
        Let’s be honest — the world often expects men to be “always on.” But your system is more honest than that. You may *feel* desire strongly, but your body won’t follow through unless the vibe, pressure, and connection feel just right.
      </p>
      <p>
        That doesn’t make you broken. It makes you emotionally intelligent. You’re someone who feels desire deeply — but only when you feel safe, seen, and respected. That’s strength, not a flaw.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ Strategies to Honor Your Wiring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🧘 <strong>Lower internal pressure:</strong> performance anxiety is a major trigger for your SIS. Focus on presence, not outcome.</li>
        <li>🗣️ <strong>Talk about what shuts you down:</strong> naming your brakes gives your partner a chance to support, not misunderstand.</li>
        <li>🎧 <strong>Curate sensory safety:</strong> soft lighting, familiar music, emotional grounding — these calm your nervous system so arousal flows.</li>
        <li>⏳ <strong>Build anticipation:</strong> your SES loves foreplay, teasing, buildup — this activates your accelerator before brakes can interfere.</li>
        <li>💡 <strong>Shift from “perform” to “experience”:</strong> you don’t need to prove anything. You need to feel everything.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <details class="explanation-box">
        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your brake — it kicks in when something feels off: performance pressure, anxiety, emotional disconnection, or unexpected distractions. A high SIS means your system is highly sensitive to these cues.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your accelerator — it responds strongly to erotic stimuli, emotional closeness, and sensuality. A high SES means you’re highly responsive — your system can light up fast when conditions are right.</p>
        <p>Together, this combo can feel like having one foot on the gas and one on the brake — the goal is to release pressure, not push harder.</p>
