      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your sexual system is thoughtful and cautious. You don’t get easily overwhelmed by fear or shame — but your arousal still tends to be quiet, slow to rise, and often depends on emotional or energetic alignment more than anything physical.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You might go through long stretches where sex or desire just doesn’t feel present. You may enjoy intimacy when it happens — but you’re rarely driven by urgency. And if the environment feels disconnected, rushed, or even slightly off… your interest may simply fade out without warning.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can feel confusing — like you’re on the edge of wanting something, but not enough to chase it. That’s not dysfunction. That’s your system doing what it does best: asking for <em>deeper signals</em> before stepping into intimacy.
      </p>
    
      <h3>🌈 For Non-Binary, Fluid, and Unscripted Identities</h3>
      <p>
        You may have never seen yourself reflected in mainstream narratives about desire. Your experience might not be loud or linear. It may live in emotional resonance, in non-sexual forms of closeness, or in subtle moments that others might overlook.
      </p>
      <p>
        You deserve to define intimacy on your own terms — not based on what others expect from your body, your identity, or your past. Desire doesn’t have to be constant to be valid.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ Supportive Practices for Your Emotional Tempo</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🧠 <strong>Pay attention to your "almost" moments:</strong> what nearly got you interested? What pulled you back? These clues matter.</li>
        <li>🕯️ <strong>Lean into calm connection:</strong> intimacy for you often begins with eye contact, softness, and emotional attunement — not stimulation.</li>
        <li>📖 <strong>Journal after intimacy:</strong> when it worked (or didn’t), write it down. You’re building your own personal arousal roadmap.</li>
        <li>🪷 <strong>Explore sensuality over sexuality:</strong> warm baths, soft fabrics, comforting smells — even if arousal doesn’t follow, it builds relationship with your body.</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Be radically honest with partners:</strong> say when you’re not in the mood, or when you're still finding your rhythm — vulnerability builds trust, not distance.</li>
      </ul>

        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your internal brake — it slows down arousal in response to emotional disconnection, stress, or fear. A medium SIS means you’re aware of those signals, but they don’t completely take over.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your gas pedal — it responds to arousal cues like emotional intimacy or physical touch. A low SES means your system needs stronger or more specific conditions to feel desire — and that’s completely valid.</p>
        <p>Your system isn’t passive — it’s just <em>discerning</em>. You don’t rush toward arousal. You move when it feels right — and that kind of wisdom is rare.</p>
