      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your sexual system is cautious, quiet, and deeply sensitive. You don’t feel arousal easily, and when you do, it’s fragile — easily interrupted by pressure, shame, or even the slightest emotional misalignment.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You might not feel desire often. You may go long stretches without it, or only notice it in very specific emotional contexts — and even then, a small disruption (stress, awkwardness, performance pressure) can make it vanish.
      </p>
      <p>
        This might’ve made you question your identity or wonder if you’re “normal.” But here’s the truth: your system isn’t broken. It’s just cautious. And in a world that glorifies intensity and urgency, you move at the speed of safety — and that’s brave.
      </p>
    
      <h3>🌈 For Those Who Live Outside the Binary</h3>
      <p>
        If you identify as non-binary, genderfluid, agender, or anywhere beyond the binary, you may feel doubly disconnected from how sexuality is often portrayed. This profile reminds you: your experience is valid. You don’t have to prove your sexuality. You get to define it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether your brakes are shaped by trauma, identity invalidation, dysphoria, or just the noise of the world — your body is trying to protect you. Let’s work with that, not against it.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ Tools That Gently Support Your System</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🛏️ <strong>Let slowness be sacred:</strong> take your time. Warmth, eye contact, quiet — you might need much more of these than you’ve been told is “normal.”</li>
        <li>📓 <strong>Keep a private, judgment-free arousal log:</strong> notice what moments helped you feel even slightly connected to desire — even non-sexual ones like emotional safety or soft touch.</li>
        <li>🧠 <strong>Understand your brakes:</strong> try writing down what shuts you down. External? Internal? Even the awareness is a step forward.</li>
        <li>🪷 <strong>Explore sensuality without expectation:</strong> try bath rituals, soft textures, movement, music — arousal doesn’t always mean “sex.”</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Speak your needs unapologetically:</strong> if something doesn’t feel right, you don’t have to explain why. “No” is a complete sentence — and your body gets to lead.</li>
      </ul>

        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your brake — it activates in response to stress, shame, disconnection, or any perceived emotional threat. A high SIS means your system is highly sensitive to negative signals — even subtle ones.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your accelerator — it responds to turn-ons, emotional safety, and erotic energy. A low SES means it takes more
