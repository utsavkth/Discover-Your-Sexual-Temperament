    <h1>What This Is</h1>
    <p>This isn’t a “fun little sex quiz.” This is a wake-up call — and a mirror.</p>
    <p>The Sexual Temperament Questionnaire is built on the science from <em>Come As You Are</em> by Dr. Emily Nagoski — a book that shattered old beliefs about desire. It’s not about how often you want sex. It’s about how your mind, body, and nervous system interact. Your libido isn’t broken. It’s just misunderstood. That changes everything.</p>

    <h2>Why I Created This</h2>
    <p>Because growing up South Asian, I saw the damage done by silence and shame. We never talked about arousal, brakes, stress, or trauma. We were just told to behave, suppress, and never ask too many questions.</p>
    <p>But science says otherwise. Desire isn’t gendered. It’s contextual. It’s flexible. And when you learn your wiring — when you understand your own brakes and accelerators — you stop blaming yourself. You start healing.</p>

    <div class="value-box">
      <ul>
        <li>🧠 Grounded in neuroscience, not tabloid nonsense</li>
        <li>🔍 Designed for introspection — not judgment</li>
        <li>🛠️ Built by someone still doing the emotional work</li>
        <li>🌏 Made for anyone raised in silence, shame, or confusion</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Real Talk: Desire is Contextual</h2>
    <p>Over the years, just by listening — especially when people are emotionally raw, drunk, or venting — I’ve heard stories that cracked open the emotional layers of desire. Friends, colleagues, and even strangers talk more than they realize when they feel safe. You start noticing patterns.</p>
    <p>I’ve heard from people in long-term relationships who feel sexually disconnected even though the love is still there. One told me, “Every time I initiate, she says, ‘You only want sex.’” The frustration wasn’t about lust — it was about being misunderstood, about timing, about emotional disconnect and stress that no one talks about.</p>
    <p>I’ve heard others say they thought their partner had a high sex drive — until suddenly things shifted. Arousal wasn’t consistent. Sometimes it was there, sometimes it vanished. What changed? Not the person — the <strong>context</strong>. Stress, routine, fear of judgment, subtle emotional shutdown — all these act like invisible brakes.</p>
    <p>The truth is, someone can be bold, flirtatious, even wild in one moment — and distant in another. That doesn’t mean they’re unpredictable. It means their nervous system is reacting to the environment. That’s what SIS and SES really explain.</p>

    <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
    <p>If you’ve ever thought, “I should want more,” or “I shouldn’t want this at all.”</p>
    <p>If your sexual self feels out of sync with who you are — or who you were told to be.</p>
    <p>If you want clarity, not labels. Curiosity, not shame. And if you’re ready to listen to your body with more compassion…</p>
    <p>This is for you.</p>

    <h2>Where It’s Going</h2>
    <p>This is phase one. Soon, you’ll get:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🌑 A dark mode that feels gentle on the eyes (and psyche)</li>
      <li>🧭 More personalized results, with partner dynamics & visuals</li>
      <li>📤 Shareable summaries and export options</li>
      <li>🎭 Pages that explore how culture, anxiety, and masking affect desire</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This isn't just a project. It's a conversation I wish someone had with me years ago.</p>
    <p>Thanks for being brave enough to start. You’re already doing the work.</p>
