      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your sexual system runs on stillness, not urgency. You don’t feel held back or ashamed about sex (low brakes), but you also don’t feel arousal rise frequently or automatically. That doesn’t make you disconnected — it makes you selective, steady, and deeply self-contained.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You may not often feel "in the mood," and that’s okay. You don’t get derailed by stress or fear, and you’re open to intimacy — but your arousal tends to show up only in very specific contexts. Or maybe it builds slowly over time, quietly and gently, rather than in bursts.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re not broken, and you’re not behind. Your system just moves differently. You respond best to meaningful connection, relaxed pacing, and experiences that honor your natural tempo.
      </p>
    
      <h3>🌈 For Those Who Don’t Fit Mainstream Scripts</h3>
      <p>
        If you identify outside the binary or feel like the usual sexual expectations don’t match you — you’re not alone. This profile often belongs to people who find intimacy in smaller, more subtle moments. You don’t need to feel desire all the time to be valid, whole, or worthy of love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether your identity includes fluidity, asexuality, queerness, neurodivergence, or simply a desire to move slowly — your experience is real, and it matters.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ Supportive Approaches for Your Quiet System</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🌱 <strong>Let intimacy unfold slowly:</strong> presence, eye contact, soft touch, silence — these may feel more meaningful than sexual “heat.”</li>
        <li>💌 <strong>Redefine desire in your own terms:</strong> you may find that emotional closeness or acts of care are more arousing than anything visual or physical.</li>
        <li>🧘 <strong>Explore sensuality without outcome:</strong> try movement, water, warmth, soft music — ways to feel good without pressure to feel “turned on.”</li>
        <li>📖 <strong>Reflect on what intimacy means to you:</strong> journaling, voice notes, or conversations with safe people can help bring clarity.</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Communicate your pace:</strong> your slowness is a gift — not everyone is ready for that kind of intentional presence, but the right people will meet you there.</li>
      </ul>

        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your internal brake — it activates with stress, fear, or misalignment. A low SIS means you’re not often shut down by external pressure — your system feels pretty relaxed about sex overall.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your gas pedal — it revs up when something turns you on. A low SES means you need strong, meaningful cues for desire to emerge — and that’s okay.</p>
        <p>This combination means you’re slow to start, slow to shut down — and in that slowness, you often find a kind of clarity the rest of the world misses.</p>
