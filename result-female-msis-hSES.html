      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your results show a powerful combo: you're highly responsive to sexual and emotional cues (SES), while still carrying a healthy level of internal caution (SIS).</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You might often find yourself feeling aroused by connection, energy, and playful flirtation. A meaningful glance, a kind gesture, or a cozy evening can all become ignition points. Your SES is sensitive — it notices, absorbs, and responds.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, your SIS quietly monitors for disconnection, stress, or emotional mismatch. If something feels off, you may suddenly pause, check out, or go cold — not because you aren’t interested, but because your body is asking, “Is this still safe?” It’s not a bug. It’s built-in wisdom.
      </p>
    
      <h3>👩‍🦰 For Women Like You</h3>
      <p>
        Society often assumes that if a woman is easily aroused, she must be "always ready." But your profile says otherwise — you may feel desire often, but it still needs to be <em>held gently</em>. Your flame burns hot, but it needs the right conditions to stay lit.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you're with someone who gets that — someone who listens, checks in, and creates space — you can thrive sexually. But when you're pressured or dismissed, your SIS kicks in to protect you. And that’s a superpower, not a problem.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ Practices That Support Your Fire</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🕯️ <strong>Curate your vibe:</strong> lighting, tone of voice, scent, warmth — these small signals turn your SES on in meaningful ways.</li>
        <li>🌬️ <strong>Manage emotional noise:</strong> small conflicts, stress, or internal doubts can subtly activate your SIS — clear them out.</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Let desire breathe:</strong> talk openly about what builds your arousal — and what quietly kills it. That transparency protects your energy.</li>
        <li>🎶 <strong>Use arousal cues intentionally:</strong> music, memory, imagination — these are powerful tools for you. Don’t wait for desire; create space for it.</li>
        <li>🫶 <strong>Balance energy and empathy:</strong> your SES may go full throttle, but always listen to your SIS if it says pause. That’s emotional intelligence at work.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <details class="explanation-box">
        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your brake — it pays attention to stress, anxiety, and emotional disconnect. Medium SIS means it doesn’t overreact, but it still taps the brakes if something doesn’t feel quite right.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your gas pedal. Yours is high, which means you respond quickly and deeply to sexual and sensual cues when things are emotionally and physically aligned.</p>
        <p>This combo makes you passionate, playful, and aware — a truly empowered sexual style.</p>
