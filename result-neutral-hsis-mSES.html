      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your sexual system is deeply intuitive. You’re sensitive to emotional shifts, body language, energy — and that sensitivity shows up in both directions: it helps you feel desire <em>and</em> it can shut that desire down just as quickly.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You may feel a gentle pull toward arousal in the right circumstances — emotional closeness, playful connection, a warm moment of eye contact. But even when it begins to build, a sudden shift in energy, a moment of pressure, or even your own inner tension can make it disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can be confusing, especially if you’ve felt desire start… and then watched it vanish without warning. But your body isn’t betraying you. It’s protecting you. Your system needs safety, softness, and slowness — and that’s not a flaw. That’s emotional precision.
      </p>
    
      <h3>🌈 For Those Who Exist Beyond the Binary</h3>
      <p>
        If you don’t fit neatly into “male” or “female,” you may carry extra emotional weight when it comes to sexuality. Gender scripts don’t always reflect your lived experience. This profile gives you permission to rewrite the script — to say, “I move differently. I need different things. And that’s valid.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re navigating identity, trauma, or simply learning to trust your own rhythms — you deserve intimacy that honors your sensitivity instead of rushing it.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ Gentle Tools That Support You</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🕯️ <strong>Set emotional tone first:</strong> talk, laugh, breathe — you need connection before arousal can flow.</li>
        <li>🧠 <strong>Reflect without judgment:</strong> when desire fades, ask what shifted. What did you need that wasn’t there?</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Be transparent about pace:</strong> let your partner know that pressure kills desire for you — but emotional depth grows it.</li>
        <li>🌙 <strong>Use slow, low-stimulation environments:</strong> gentle music, soft lighting, and cozy clothes can help relax your SIS so your SES can rise.</li>
        <li>📖 <strong>Track moments of desire:</strong> you might find patterns that help you create conditions where arousal returns gently and consistently.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <details class="explanation-box">
        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your brake — it notices anything that feels unsafe, disconnected, or pressured. High SIS means your system is quick to hit the brakes in those moments, often before you consciously realize why.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your accelerator — it responds to turn-ons, emotional intimacy, sensuality, and the right cues. Medium SES means desire can grow — but it needs the right conditions.</p>
        <p>Your system isn’t broken. It’s calibrated to seek intimacy that’s real, reciprocal, and rooted in trust. That’s a strength.</p>
