      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your sexual temperament reflects a thoughtful pace. You’re not easily shut down (moderate brakes), but you also don’t feel arousal rise quickly or automatically (low gas). That’s not a problem — it’s your body asking for safety, space, and connection before desire kicks in.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You might not think about sex as often as others seem to. Even when things are going well emotionally, it can take a while for you to feel sexually engaged. You’re open, but you’re also tuned in — you won’t just flip a switch unless it feels right.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, stress, awkward moments, or emotional distance can quietly slow things down or make you zone out. Your SIS is moderate — not hyper-vigilant, but definitely active. That means emotional alignment matters more than pressure or performance.
      </p>
    
      <h3>🧠 For Men Like You</h3>
      <p>
        Society rarely makes space for slower sexual rhythms in men. If you’ve ever wondered, “Why don’t I feel more?” — it’s not because anything’s wrong. You’re not broken. You’re just not easily flipped into arousal mode without the *right ingredients*.
      </p>
      <p>
        When connection, comfort, and emotional tone line up, your desire can show up in a grounded, meaningful way. And that kind of desire? It’s deeply present, not just reactive.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ What Helps You Feel More Alive, Not Just “Aroused”</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🧘 <strong>Start with calm, not stimulation:</strong> your system responds best to low-pressure, emotionally rich moments — not intensity.</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Talk about emotional readiness:</strong> arousal for you often starts in the heart and mind — naming that helps your partner meet you there.</li>
        <li>🌙 <strong>Create quiet space for desire:</strong> a long walk, slow touch, or just undistracted presence — these are powerful mood-setters for your SES.</li>
        <li>🪞 <strong>Notice subtle cues:</strong> what made you feel most connected in past intimate moments? What killed the vibe? Those patterns matter.</li>
        <li>📓 <strong>Journal your inner landscape:</strong> this can help you decode what lights your SES up — and what shuts it down.</li>
      </ul>

        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your brake — it activates in response to pressure, emotional disconnect, or mental stress. A medium SIS means you can flow in the right environment, but your system still notices if something feels off.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your accelerator — it responds to turn-ons, emotional cues, and erotic stimuli. A low SES means those cues need to be stronger or more specific for arousal to happen.</p>
        <p>Bottom line: you’re emotionally attuned. You don’t rush. You arrive fully, when it matters — and that’s your power.</p>
