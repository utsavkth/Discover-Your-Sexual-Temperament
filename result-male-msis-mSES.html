      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your sexual temperament is thoughtful, balanced, and responsive. You’re not overpowered by desire, and you’re not shut down by stress. Your arousal depends on connection, safety, and the right emotional environment — and when those are there, you can show up fully.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        You probably don’t get turned on just from physical cues alone — you need emotional and psychological alignment too. A good conversation, warmth from a partner, or a shared intimate space can help your arousal build naturally. But when things feel off, awkward, or pressured? Your brakes gently engage, and your body says, “Not right now.”
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re not someone who flips instantly between “on” and “off.” Your system pays attention. And that makes you an intentional, grounded sexual partner — not a reactive one.
      </p>
    
      <h3>🧠 For Men Like You</h3>
      <p>
        Your profile isn’t flashy — and that’s exactly why it works. You’re not driven by compulsion, and you’re not ruled by fear. You’re responsive to the right vibe, the right partner, the right moment. That’s healthy. That’s human.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes you might wonder why others seem to feel desire more intensely or frequently. But your desire runs on *honesty*, not adrenaline. You don’t need chaos to feel connected — you need clarity and care.
      </p>
    
      <h3>✅ How to Stay In Tune with Your System</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🕯️ <strong>Build atmosphere, not pressure:</strong> set the emotional tone before the physical one — it’ll bring your SES online more smoothly.</li>
        <li>💬 <strong>Be clear about your rhythms:</strong> let your partner know that your desire is real, even if it’s not “urgent.”</li>
        <li>🎶 <strong>Use emotional music, memories, or narratives:</strong> your SES might respond better to mental and emotional stimulation than purely visual.</li>
        <li>🪞 <strong>Reflect after intimacy:</strong> what made it work? What stalled it? Learning this deepens your connection — with yourself and others.</li>
        <li>🌱 <strong>Stay emotionally regulated:</strong> even moderate stress can quietly activate your SIS. Check in with your mind, not just your body.</li>
      </ul>

        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your brake — it activates when you sense emotional tension, anxiety, or anything that feels off. A medium SIS means you’re sensitive to these signals, but not overwhelmed by them.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your gas pedal — it revs up when you experience arousal cues like intimacy, closeness, and emotional safety. A medium SES means desire shows up, but not automatically — it builds with context.</p>
        <p>This combo means you’re emotionally attuned, not overly reactive. You’re someone who responds when it’s real, not just when it’s available — and that’s real strength.</p>
