      <p>Hey <strong><span id="namePlaceholder">friend</span></strong>, your profile shows a high sensitivity to sexual cues — paired with a moderate tendency to hit the brakes when something feels off.</p>
    
      <h3>💡 What This Looks Like in Real Life</h3>
      <p>You're likely someone who feels desire often — maybe even strongly. A subtle cue, a romantic vibe, or physical closeness can switch things on fast. Your body says “yes” to the right signals, and your SES (sexual accelerator) fires up easily.</p>
    
      <p>But if something in the context doesn’t sit right — tension, disconnection, performance pressure — your SIS (the brake system) starts whispering, and desire might fizzle. This isn’t dysfunction. It’s your nervous system saying: “Wait. Are we safe here?”</p>
    
      <h3>🧠 For Men Like You</h3>
      <p>Let’s get honest — you’ve probably been told that men should “always be ready,” or that high arousal = high performance. But your system is more layered. You may <em>want</em> sex, but not feel fully present for it. You may <em>get turned on</em> but struggle to stay tuned in. And that can be frustrating.</p>
    
      <p>But this profile is powerful. It means your arousal is rich, responsive, and sensitive — but it also asks for emotional attunement. You’re not a robot. You’re a real human being with layers.</p>
    
      <h3>✅ Ways to Support Your Sexual Style</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🎧 <strong>Set the tone:</strong> music, lighting, comfort — arousal flows best in environments that help you feel grounded and relaxed.</li>
        <li>🗣️ <strong>Talk it out:</strong> if something’s off, name it. Reducing low-grade stress can make space for your SES to shine.</li>
        <li>🕯️ <strong>Slow down:</strong> even if desire shows up fast, connection still takes time. Stay in the moment.</li>
        <li>📱 <strong>Be mindful of distractions:</strong> overstimulation (screens, pressure, rushed moments) can keep your body turned on but your mind checked out.</li>
        <li>💪 <strong>Shift from “perform” to “feel”:</strong> your worth isn’t in performance. It's in presence.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <details class="explanation-box">
        <summary>🔍 What do SIS and SES actually mean?</summary>
        <p><strong>SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)</strong> is your internal brake. It watches for emotional, mental, or environmental signals that say “slow down.” Medium SIS means you're sensitive to pressure, disconnection, or stress — but you’re not ruled by it.</p>
        <p><strong>SES (Sexual Excitation System)</strong> is your gas pedal. It kicks in when you feel turned on, emotionally connected, or stimulated. A high SES means your body responds strongly to the right vibes — and wants more.</p>
        <p>This combo is intense but sensitive. To thrive, it needs emotional clarity, safety, and trust — not just stimulation.</p>
